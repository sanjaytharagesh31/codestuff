//Minimum Platforms 
//Given arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station. Your task is to find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train waits.
//Note: Consider that all the trains arrive on the same day and leave on the same day. Also, arrival and departure times will not be same for a train, but we can have arrival time of one train equal to departure of the other.
//In such cases, we need different platforms, i.e at any given instance of time, same platform can not be used for both departure of a train and arrival of another.


int findPlatform(int arr[], int dep[], int n) {
    sort(arr, arr+n);
    sort(dep, dep+n);
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    int ans = 0;
    int res = 0;
    while(i<n && j<n) {
        if(arr[i] < dep[j]) {
            ans++;
            i++;
            res = max(res, ans);
        }
        else if(arr[i] == dep[j]) {
            ans++;
            i++;
            res = max(res, ans);
        }
        else {
            ans--;
            j++;
