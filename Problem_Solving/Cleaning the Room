/*
Akansha keeps her room untidy. She has thrown pencils all over the floor. Her mother came and gave her a box to put her pencils in.
She found some of the pencils cannot be put in the box. To put them away from the sight of her mother, she threw them in the backyard.
Can you help Akansha in determining which pencil will fit in the box and which pencils have to be thrown in the backyard.
