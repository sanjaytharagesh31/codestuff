/*
You have been given an array of integers with both positive and negative numbers. You need to find a pair of numbers such that its sum is closest or equal to zero.
If you have many pairs with sum closest to zero, print the pair whose smaller value is smallest among all the pairs.
For example: For the array: [-4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4], there are 4 pairs whose sum is closest to zero. The four pairs are: (-4, 4), (-3, 3), (-2, 2) and (-1, 1). Out of these pairs, the smallest of smaller values is -4, so, the answer should be the pair: (-4, 4).
